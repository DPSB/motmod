To: Agent Zolotnitsky<br>
Urgent!<br><br>

<tab>It has been reported that 
a meeting between Gestapo Standartenführer Gerd Richter and our courier Ivan Melnik will soon take place in 'Chateau de Limothe,' a southern Parisian suburb in the 'Perigord' province.<br>

<tab>Our informant suspects that the courier is preparing to defect to the enemy, which would result in critical information about our network in Paris falling into enemy hands.<br>
<tab>It is of the utmost importance that we ascertain the facts of the situation. Upon completion of your mission, you are to file a report within three hours, identifying all agents
or groups that may be involved. If, over the course of your mission, you are able to confirm our informant's story, then you are to immediately carry out a 
'Black Operation': neutralize the defector, then report.<br>
<tab>In any case, communicate without delay the results of your investigation.<br>
