<tab>According to 'Dario,' our source at Bletchley Park, classified documents which may enable the Americans to decipher our messages have fallen into the hands of British intelligence.<br>
<tab>In particular, it has been reported that these documents contain a code book of fifteen hundred pages, stolen from a Soviet radio operator. We suspect that these materials will be handed over to American agents very shortly. 
Their recovery is essential, as these codes are still in active use, and are planned to be used during the upcoming 'Venona' operation.<br>

<tab>The Chief Counterintelligence Directorate has ordered you to develop and implement, within six hours, a plan to recover the documents, 
 taking into consideration all possible contingencies and scenarios which might jeopardize the operation.<br>

<tab>Within two hours, you are to provide all necessary information to agents or groups who may need to be mobilized in advance of your insertion at Bletchley.<br>
