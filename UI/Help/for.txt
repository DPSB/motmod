Uniforms:<br><br>
<tab>-<sp> You can acquire a uniform by: <l="game:UI\Help\Infighting.txt">stunning</l>, <l="game:UI\Help\cold_wepon.txt">choking (using a garrotte or chloroform)</l>, or <l="game:UI\Help\fire_wepon.txt">shooting</l> the enemy in the head (only on 'Easy' and 'Normal' difficulty levels). At 'Saboteur' difficulty level you cannot change your uniform.<br> 
<tab>-<sp> If you are wearing an officer's uniform, you can <l="game:UI\Help\menu.txt">give orders</l> to some privates.<br>
<tab>-<sp> You can carry an additional uniform with you in a <l="game:UI\Help\invetory.txt">backpack.</l><br>
<tab>-<sp> If an enemy<l="game:UI\Help\alarm.txt">has discovered</l> the main hero, his disguise is compromised. Enemies exchange information about your disguise when they come in contact with one another for any length of time.<br>
<tab>-<sp> If an enemy finds a body without a uniform, then the uniform of the neutralized character becomes suspect. If an enemy who has examined such a body sees the player wearing the stolen uniform, his status will immediately change to hostile.<br>
