<tab>-<sp> The player can carry the body of any neutralized enemy. To do this, you must approach the body and select the 'Pick up the body' item on the <l="game:UI\Help\menu.txt">"Action menu."</l><br> 
<tab>-<sp> There are two ways to get rid of a body: carefully put the body down ("Left mouse button" by default) or throw the body ("Right mouse button" by default).<br>
